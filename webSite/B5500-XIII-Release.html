    Burroughs B5500 Mark XIII Release ZIP Archive
</h1>

<p>The <code>B5500-XIII-Release.zip</code> archive file contains the source and object code for the entire Mark XIII release of late 1971, translated from 6-bit B5500 internal code to ASCII, using the standard retro-b5500 substitutions for the B5500 characters that do not have ASCII equivalents. The download <code>.zip</code> file size is 5.2MiB, expanding to 28.2MiB.

<p>The files converted from the tape images are in standard Windows text format (CR-LF delimiters), but their file names do not have extensions. They can be opened in any text editor than can handle ASCII with CR-LF delimiters.

<p>Note that the object code is not usable in this representation, but since all 6-bit B5500 codes have printable ASCII glyphs, the object code is in what amounts to a specialized base-64 encoding.
